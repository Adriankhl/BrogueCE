The tiles font files are based on the the tiles from Oryx Design Lab's "Brogue
Tiles" which can be found here https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/games and are
licensed under the AGPL license (which can be found in the root directory of this
project.)

If you like them, a commercially licensed expanded tile set can be found here

Font size 10 is the default size when using tiles (--size 10 when launching from
the commandline.) Other sizes are scaled based on this file and may have
lessened clarity.
