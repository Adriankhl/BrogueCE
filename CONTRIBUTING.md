Contributing
============

Making changes to a game is quite different to other software projects because
the standard for a "good contribution" is rather subjective and goes beyond
just "is it functional and useful?" Non-trivial gameplay changes should be
framed as solving a problem with the game: they should be filed as an issue
with a description the change in as much detail as possible, together with
a rationale. Obviously, plenty of experience playing the game helps here.

We have a Discord server for discussion -- you can join it with invite code

When submitting patches:

- Keep your commit history clean of errors and fixups
- Write commit summaries in imperative tense, keep them short (<= 70 chars)
and wrap the rest of the message at 80 chars. (See the current history
for examples)
- Add changes users would care about to the CHANGELOG, in non-technical
language
- Respect the style of the existing code, including indentation (4 spaces)
