*Brogue* is a single-player strategy game set in the halls of a mysterious
and randomly-generated dungeon. The objective is simple enough -- retrieve the
fabled Amulet of Yendor from the 26th level -- but the dungeon is riddled with
danger. Horrifying creatures and devious, trap-ridden terrain await. Yet it is
also riddled with weapons, potions, and artifacts of forgotten power. Survival
demands strength and cunning in equal measure as you descend, making the most
of what the dungeon gives you. You will make sacrifices, narrow escapes,
and maybe even some friends along the way -- but will you be one of the
lucky few to return alive?
