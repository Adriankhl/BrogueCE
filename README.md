Brogue: Community Edition is a codebase for the roguelike
[Brogue](https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/) by Brian Walker. It has
several goals:

- add community-accepted bugfixes and game changes
- provide a cross-platform build system
- be a convenient base for forks and ports to new platforms
